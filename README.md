## Overview

Namer App is a Flutter application that generates a list of potential startup names. The names are randomly generated from English words, providing a wide variety of unique and interesting names for your next project.

## Features

- **Random Name Generation**: The application generates a list of startup names by combining English words. This ensures that you always have a fresh and unique set of names to choose from.

- **Favorites**: Found a name that you love? Simply tap on it to save it to your favorites. This allows you to easily keep track of names that catch your interest.

- **Saved Suggestions**: You can view all your saved names in a separate page. This makes it easy to review your favorite names whenever you want.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Names**: When you open the app, you'll be presented with a list of randomly generated startup names.

2. **Save Names**: If you find a name that you like, tap on it to save it. The name will be highlighted to indicate that it's saved.

3. **View Saved Names**: Tap on the list icon in the top-right corner of the app to view all your saved names.
